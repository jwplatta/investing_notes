**Types of Funds**

**Order Book**


How do hedge funds exploit market mechanics?
- **Order book exploit**: Hedge fund's computers are placed close to the exchange and continually watches the exchange's order book. The hedge fund buys stock based on the order book activity. Given the fund's proximity to the exchange, it can buy stock and sell it to investors further away in milliseconds to profit. The hedge fund is exploiting other investors that observe the order book later than it does.
- **Geographic market exploit**: A hedge fund places servers close to exchanges located in different parts of the world. The hedge fund connects its servers with some high-speed cabel. The servers communicate and look for inefficiencies between the two exchanges in order to exploit them.
