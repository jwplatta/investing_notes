# Trading Strategies

Algorithmic trading strategies often combine many indicators in ordre to produce a profitable trading strategy.

## RSI and EMA

One possible trading strategy is to combine RSI with a moving average such as an exponential moving average (EMA). A trader might look to the intersection of a long EMA and short EMA of an asset’s price in order to confirm RSI indication that the asset is overbought/oversold: Confirmation of an overbought asset would be the short EMA sinking below the long EMA and confirmation of an oversold asset would be the short EMA rising above the long EMA.

## Long and Short EMAs

A simple strategy using EMA is to look for crossovers between a short EMA and a long EMA. Crossovers between these lines potentially indicate a change in trend that’s an opportunity to enter or exit the market. A trader might treat the short EMA sinking below the long EMA as a sell signal because it indicates a downward shift in the price trend. A buy signal might be when the short EMA rises above the long EMA because it indicates an upward shift in the price trend.

## Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

Sometimes the MACD line is plotted with a signal line that’s an EMA of the MACD and a “histogram” that’s the difference of the MACD and signal line. A possible strategy using MACD is to look for crossovers between the signal line and the MACD line. The MACD crossing above the signal line indicates upward momentum. Thus, it might be an opportunity to enter the market. The MACD crossing below the signal line indicates downward momentum. Thus, it might be an opportunity to exit the market.

## EMAs and Ulcer Index

One possible strategy is to use the UI to confirm downward trends indicated by crossovers of short and long EMAs. A high UI indicates significant risk of a drawdown which corroborates downward momentum indicated by the short EMA sinking below the long EMA. In turn, this suggests a potential opportunity to exit the market. Alternatively, low UI indicates there’s not significant risk of a drawdown which suggests the downward momentum indicated by the EMAs is temporary.
